    <p id="title"> Project Name: Colors of Love</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Colors of Love" was a vibrant Holi Festival organized by our Leo club in celebration of
      Valentine’s Day. Beyond traditional expressions of affection, we aimed to foster fellowship and
      friendship among club members while enhancing interpersonal skills and event management
      capabilities. Amidst economic challenges, we provided a low-cost opportunity for Leos to bond,
      share love, and alleviate stress. Additionally, we sought to promote our club within the
      university community, attracting newcomers and showcasing our commitment to charitable
      endeavors. Led by Project Chairman Leo Melissa Handapangoda, "Colors of Love" epitomized
      the spirit of camaraderie and celebration. This project emerged as the winner of “Best Project
      for Fellowship” and the first runner-up for the “Best Project for Public Relations” during the
      Insperenzo Awards; the 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.
