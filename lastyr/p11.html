    <p id="title"> Project Name: “D.E.A.D. (Drugs End All Dreams)"</p>
    <br>
    <p>“D.E.A.D. (Drugs End All Dreams)" aimed to educate students on the detrimental effects of drug
      usage, fostering a shift in attitudes towards substance abuse. Collaborating with the Moratuwa
      Police and school officials, our project emphasized the long-term consequences of drug use,
      highlighting alternative methods for a fulfilling life. Through awareness programs and group
      activities, we successfully conveyed the message of drug prevention and rehabilitation to
      students. Led by Project Chairman Leo Nipuni Wijesekara, our initiative focused on empowering
      youth to make informed choices and safeguard their futures. This project was awarded as the
      2
      nd Runner-Up for the “Best Project for Drug Prevention and Rehabilitation” during the
      Insperenzo Awards; 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.
