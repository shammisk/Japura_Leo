    <p id="title"> Project Name: Apekshawata Apekshawak</p>
    <br>
    <p>The community project "Apekshawata Apekshawak" was launched to address the critical
      shortage of medications for pediatric cancer patients at Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, amidst
      the country's economic crisis. By fundraising for essential medicine donations and raising
      awareness through flyers and videos, we aimed to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable children
      and prevent potential medical disasters. Led by Project Chairman Leo Ranudika Dinenthi, our
      initiative received positive feedback from hospital staff, marking the successful first phase of
      our project. Falling under the categories of "Pediatric Cancer" and "Disaster Management and
      Prevention," our efforts strive to provide timely support and spotlight the urgent needs of
      pediatric patients. This Project was awarded as the winner of the category “Best Project for
      Pediatric Cancer” during the Insperenzo Awards; 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District
      306 C2.</p>
