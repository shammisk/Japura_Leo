    <p id="title"> Project Name: Diabet Care
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The project "Diabet Care" aimed to raise awareness about diabetes and provide screening for
      non-academic staff at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Organized by the Leo Club, the
      free testing camp targeted undergraduates and laborers. Led by Project Chairmen Leo
      Shamindya Rupasinghe and Leo Himashi Lokuge, the initiative received positive feedback, with
      over 120 tests conducted. By prioritizing the well-being of members and supporting staff, we
      strive to continue organizing health-oriented programs in the future and this project was
      awarded as the first Runner for the category “Best Project for Diabetes” during the Insperenzo
      Awards; 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.
