    <p id="title"> Project Name: EduKids</p>
    <br>
    <p>"EduKids" represents a groundbreaking initiative under the category of research and
      development, targeting preschool students and their families to address economic challenges.
      Our primary goal was to explore modern learning methods and devise a cost-effective solution,
      leading to the development of a mobile app accessible via data connection. Focusing on
      subjects like English Language, our aim was to provide all children with equal opportunities for
      growth and integration into their communities. Led by Project Chairman Leo Sewmini Sanjana,
      "EduKids" strives to empower children from low-income families, recognizing education as the
      cornerstone of a brighter future. This project was awarded as the winner for the category of
      “Best Project for Research and Development” during the Insperenzo Awards; 18th Annual
      District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.</p>
