    <p id="title"> Project Name: Diviyata Aruthak</p>
    <br>
    <p>The project, "Diviyata Aruthak" led by Leo Ovindu Dilanka marked an initial stride towards
        spotlighting children's mental health and well-being. The inaugural visit was to Piliyandala
        Delthara Primary School which targeted students from grades 8 to 11, along with parents of
        younger children. Dr. Bhathiya Dasanayake, a distinguished psychiatrist and early childhood
        development specialist, was selected as our resource person. With a focus on nurturing mental
        wellness and providing invaluable support and guidance to children and families alike, this
        project was able to win the award for “Best Project for Mental Health and Well-being” during
        the Insperenzo Awards; 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.</p>
