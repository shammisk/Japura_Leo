    <p id="title"> Project Name: Sahas Diyawara
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>"Sahas Diyawara" was a transformative project aimed at providing safe drinking water to
      Kongala Abhaya Central College, addressing a critical water scarcity issue in a rural area of Sri
      Lanka. Our initiative not only ensured a sustainable clean water system for daily needs but also
      supported sanitary requirements, benefiting the school community and their agricultural
      endeavors. Through this project, we aimed to raise awareness about the importance of
      consuming safe and sanitary water to reduce diseases, emphasizing its vital role in public health
      and economic development. This valuable project was led by the Project Chairman Leo Poorni
      Kaushalya. Recognized for its impact, "Sahas Diyawara" was able to become the “Best Project
      for Clean Water and Energy Conservation” and the First Runner up for the “Most Outstanding
      Project” during the Insperenzo Awards; 18th Annual District Conference of Leo District 306 C2.
      Moreover, this project was also able to secure the spot of the winner for the “Best Community
      Service Project” during the J’pura Employability Skills Awards 2024.
