    <p id="title"> Project Name: Happy Cure - Phase 01</p>
    <br>
    <p>The "Happy Cure" project, conducted at The Salvation Army's Child Development Center in
      Rajagiriya, successfully promoted the holistic well-being of children under 16. The project,
      guided by two medical students, examined children's dental and eye conditions, referred those
      in need for treatment, and focused on nurturing their educational aspirations. The team
      engaged with the children, identifying areas needing support and inspiring them to pursue their
      goals. The project highlighted the interconnectedness of health and education, and the lessons
      learned from it can inspire future efforts to nurture children's physical and educational needs.</p>
