    <p>Incoming club members must understand the organization and its functions to ensure its
      longevity. The orientation program, attended by 44 new officers, covered three fundamental
      aspects of Leoism: its impact on society, sustainable quality projects, and self-improvement.
      Former club officers shared their experiences, providing valuable insights for new members.
      Leoism is a powerful tool for personal growth and community improvement.
      The orientation aimed to inspire new and existing members to engage in Leoism, embrace
      philanthropic endeavors, and seize leadership opportunities. It provided a strong foundation,
      historical aspects, and project details, fostering a sense of community engagement and longterm dedication.</p>
