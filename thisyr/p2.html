    <p>To promote sustainability and empower the community the Leos of the University of Sri
      Jayewardenepura made a significant contribution to the Parama Dhamma Nivesa Pirivena
      Temple, Borelesgamuwa by donating a Solar Panel and a generator. These solar panels were
      given to us by the Leo Club of Royal College. The objective of this endeavor was to equip the
      temple with sustainable energy methods, thereby minimizing its carbon footprint and cutting
      down on electricity expenses. We wanted to encourage environmental responsibility in the
      community and support the temple's sustainability goals with this donation. The
      accomplishment of this donation not only strengthens the temple's energy resilience but also
      shows how dedicated our Leos are to environmental stewardship and community service.</p>
