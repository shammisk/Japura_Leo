    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>-Phase 01-</h3>
    <p>Incoming club members must understand the organization and its functions to ensure its
      longevity. The orientation program, attended by 44 new officers, covered three fundamental
      aspects of Leoism: its impact on society, sustainable quality projects, and self-improvement.
      Former club officers shared their experiences, providing valuable insights for new members.
      Leoism is a powerful tool for personal growth and community improvement.
      The orientation aimed to inspire new and existing members to engage in Leoism, embrace
      philanthropic endeavors, and seize leadership opportunities. It provided a strong foundation,
      historical aspects, and project details, fostering a sense of community engagement and longterm dedication.</p>

      <h3>-Phase 02-</h3>
      <p>New members of a university Leo club must understand the organization and its functions to
        contribute to the betterment of the community. Leoism, leadership, and opportunity are
        essential for a young individual's life. However, proper guidance and education are needed to
        utilize opportunities effectively. Mentoring new and existing members on how to use their skills
        and talents for the betterment of Leoism benefits both the community and the club.<br><br>
        A two-hour online orientation program was conducted for 234 Leos, covering three main
        aspects of Leoism: its impact on society, planning quality projects for sustainability, and
        improving oneself through Leoism. The program was led by Club President Leo Nipuni
        Wijesekara, Guest of Honor Leo Ridma Sirimanna, and Chief Guest Leo Lion Melissa
        Handapangoda. The goal was to motivate and inspire new members to engage in Leo moment,
        service philanthropy, and leadership opportunities. The information provided a foundation for
        new members, helping them understand the club's functions, roles, history, traditions, vision,
        quality projects, and participation opportunities. Proper orientation leads to the betterment of
        Leoism and the establishment of the club's name among the audience.</p>
