    <p>On January 31st, 2024, 16 individuals participated in a cleanup initiative at Sri Pada, focusing on
      environmental conservation and preserving the sacred site's beauty. The group sorted collected
      trash into recyclables and non-recyclables, setting aside plastic bottles, cans, and recycling
      paper. Other waste was disposed of responsibly. The efforts not only removed litter but also
      minimized environmental impact. Visitors were drawn to the cleanup, inspiring others to join.
      The team demonstrated the effectiveness of collective efforts and established a standard for
      conscientious environmental protection and waste management.</p>
