    <p id="title"> Project Name: The REGREEN SRI LANKA
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The REGREEN SRI LANKA project, held on January 28th, 2024, involved 20 Leos in an awareness
      program, bird-watching session, field visit, mangrove plantation, and waste management
      activities. The project aimed to create a sustainable impact on Muthurajawela Wetland and its
      surrounding community. Permission was obtained from the Muthurajawela Visiting Centre
      manager, and social media was used to spread the project's message. Mangrove plants were
      collected from near Ja Ela, and refreshment orders were given to relevant people. The day
      began with an awareness program.<br><br>
      The community was urged to understand the significance of wetland ecosystems, wildlife
      conservation, and sustainable living practices. A boat ride was conducted, and participants
      were guided by staff to collect garbage from the Negombo lagoon area. The waste
      management program involved collecting garbage bags and rubber gloves, and observing water
      pollution affecting plants and the ecosystem. After completing the mangrove plantation,
      participants participated in bird-watching sessions and field visits. Muthurajawela wetland is
      home to many threatened species, including 40 known fish species, 45% of native inland fish
      species in Sri Lanka, and 22 endemic mammals, including the globally endangered grey slender
      loris. The restoration of the wetland contributes to protecting these important endemic and
      threatened species. By taking this initiative, the community can contribute to the protection of
      these vital ecosystems
